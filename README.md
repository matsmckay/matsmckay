Greetings! I am a passionate Software Developer with a strong foundation in web development and a keen enthusiasm for staying up-to-date with industry trends and best practices. My journey in web development began with Juno, an intensive and focused 3-month training program. Throughout the bootcamp, I delved into front-end development, honing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. Additionally, I gained valuable experience in back-end development using Firebase and RESTful APIs.

The immersive bootcamp provided me with hands-on experience in building web applications and websites from scratch. It equipped me with a solid understanding of web development concepts, tools, and the ability to create functional, aesthetically pleasing, responsive, and accessible websites and applications. I continue to code every day, refining and expanding my knowledge in the tech stack taught at Juno while exploring new languages such as Node.js and Express.js for back-end development. This allows me to work with an ever-expanding range of web technologies and tools.

Please take a moment to explore my portfolio, where you can find a showcase of my projects and coding skills, including relevant experience gained during the bootcamp. My work demonstrates my ability to learn and adapt quickly, highlighting my enthusiasm for web development and my commitment to staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and best practices.

In addition to my web development journey, I underwent a comprehensive program at Centennial College, preparing me for a career in journalism and media. This experience provided me with a strong foundation in journalism theory, ethics, and best practices. I developed practical skills in reporting, writing, editing, and multimedia production. Throughout my studies, I gained hands-on experience producing news stories, feature articles, and multimedia content using various platforms and tools. Conducting interviews, researching and fact-checking information, and writing for diverse audiences and media outlets are also among my strengths.

Furthermore, I hold a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Toronto, where I pursued a rigorous and interdisciplinary program focusing on biology, physiology, anatomy, and health sciences. This four-year degree enhanced my understanding of the human body and its biological processes, including genetics, immunology, and neuroscience. The program provided me with a strong foundation in scientific research methods, critical thinking, and practical laboratory skills. Analyzing complex biological data, interpreting scientific literature, and effectively communicating findings to diverse audiences are areas where I excel.

I am excited to contribute my skills and knowledge to impactful projects and collaborate with passionate individuals in the world of software development. Let's connect and explore how we can create meaningful solutions together.
